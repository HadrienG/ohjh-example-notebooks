# Meet the *Personal Data Notebooks* on *Open Humans*

The [*Personal Data Notebooks* on *Open Humans*](https://www.openhumans.org/activity/personal-data-notebooks/) allow you to explore and analyze your personal data that's stored in your *Open Humans* account right in your web browser. Our Director of Research, Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, has written about how this can help bridging our growing divide between people and algorithms. *[If you've come here because of the presentation at the Sage Assembly: this is literally just that talk as a blog post]*.

Below you will find a step-by-step guide with how to get started with the *Personal Data Notebooks* and some more information about the example notebooks we already provide.



## Getting started

### Setting up your *Open Humans* account
1. [Create an account with Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/account/signup/) or [log in into your existing account](https://www.openhumans.org/account/login/). If you have just created your account you will need to verify your email address before you can continue with the next steps.
2. Connect some data sources to your *Open Humans* account. While we have a lot of interesting data sources, our example Notebooks work with one or multiple of the following data sources (note, by default **none** of the uploaded/connected data will be made public):
  - [Fitbit](https://www.openhumans.org/activity/fitbit)
  - [Apple HealthKit](https://www.openhumans.org/activity/open-humans-healthkit-integration/)
  - [Twitter archives](https://www.openhumans.org/activity/twitter-archive-analyzer/)
